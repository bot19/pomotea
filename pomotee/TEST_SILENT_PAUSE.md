# Silent Pause Handling Test

## Problem Solved

The timer was getting silently paused when the browser tab lost focus, causing inaccurate time tracking.

## New Solution

The app now tracks real elapsed time using `startTime` and `currentTime` timestamps, calculating completed pomodoros based on actual time passed rather than just counting down.

## How to Test

### 1. Basic Functionality

1. Start the timer (22 minutes)
2. Let it run for a few seconds
3. Switch to another tab or application
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Return to the pomotee tab
6. **Expected**: Timer should show the correct remaining time based on real elapsed time

### 2. Silent Pause Recovery

1. Start the timer
2. Switch away from the tab immediately
3. Wait for the full pomodoro duration (22 minutes)
4. Return to the tab
5. **Expected**: Timer should show 0:00 and the pomodoro should be marked as complete

### 3. Multiple Pomodoros During Silent Pause

1. Start the timer
2. Switch away from the tab
3. Wait for 2-3 full pomodoro cycles (44-66 minutes)
4. Return to the tab
5. **Expected**: Should see 2-3 completed pomodoros in the tracker

### 4. Page Reload Recovery

1. Start the timer
2. Let it run for a few minutes
3. Refresh the page
4. **Expected**: Timer should resume with correct remaining time

## Data Structure Changes

### Old Structure

```json
{
  "date": "2025-06-20",
  "current": {
    "startTime": "2025-06-19T13:38:17.997Z",
    "completed": false,
    "timeLeft": 969
  },
  "done": []
}
```

### New Structure

```json
{
  "date": "2025-06-20",
  "current": {
    "startTime": "2025-06-19T13:38:17.997Z",
    "currentTime": "2025-06-19T14:00:17.997Z",
    "stopTime": null,
    "totalPomo": 0
  },
  "done": [
    {
      "startTime": "2025-06-19T13:38:17.997Z",
      "currentTime": "2025-06-19T14:00:17.997Z",
      "stopTime": "2025-06-19T14:00:17.997Z",
      "totalPomo": 1
    }
  ],
  "totalPomos": 1
}
```

## Key Features

- **Real-time tracking**: Uses actual timestamps instead of countdown
- **Background monitoring**: Checks every 10 seconds for silent pauses
- **Automatic recovery**: Calculates missed pomodoros when tab regains focus
- **Persistent state**: Survives page reloads and browser restarts
- **Accurate counting**: Tracks total pomodoros completed, not just manually stopped ones

## Technical Implementation

- Background interval runs every 10 seconds when timer is active
- `calculateCompletedPomos()` determines how many pomodoros should be complete
- `getRemainingTime()` calculates remaining time for current pomodoro
- `updateCurrentPomoTime()` updates the current timestamp in storage
- Automatic pomodoro completion when real time exceeds duration
