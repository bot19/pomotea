# Pomotea

A simple Pomodoro app with my own spin on it. Ongoing pomos, show productive hours, auto track daily up to a month.

Why? 2 reasons.

1: I don't like all the pomo systems out there, they are all the same. When I'm in the zone, I can do 3-6 pomos in 1 go, it should just auto keep track. I also don't need all the other features.

2: want to try out building with AI.

## 🏁 Features/objectives

1. Pomos, once started will keep rolling over to the next until stop.
2. Will auto track pomos daily
3. Will use localStorage to store daily pomos for a month
4. test out building with AI
